This is a small app created to help my friends and I enjoy a darts game we enjoyed growing up. If you'd like to see a live version of it then head to:

There are currently two games made available to play here Cricket and Super Cricket. Super Cricket is the game that we couldn't find a scoring app for. 
The score boards enforce the game rules for each game.

This app is created in Next.js and hosted on Vercel. I've kept all the logic client side as I intend to add a Service worker to allow for offline play.

I'll keep updating and adding games to make this more fleshed out for us all to enjoy.
